# DLSim

This site mains the source code and Windows-based release for DLSim package. DLSim is an open-source AMS library for efficiently macroscopic and mesoscopic traffic simulation tool based on [General Modeling Network Specification (GMNS)](https://github.com/zephyr-data-specs/GMNS) format.

 ### Mini-Lesson on the Internal Algorithmic Details

[Mini-lessson](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rorZAhNNOf0&feature=youtu.be) : What is the best way to learn dynamic traffic simulation and network assignment for a beginner? Do you want to integrate a powerful traffic simulator in your deep learning framework? We would like to offer a collaborative learning experience through 500 lines of python codes and real-life data sets. This is part of our mini-lessons through teaching dialog.

Please download latest DTALite-NeXTA package, which follows calendar versioning. Here are the user guides for NeXTA and NeXTA+QGIS using GMNS data format. We have prepared a number of self-learning documents too.
